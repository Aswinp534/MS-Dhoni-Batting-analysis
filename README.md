Is MS Dhoni still good enough to bat?

One of the greatest finishers in the history of white-ball cricket, Chennai Super Kings captain MS Dhoni is struggling to finish games? Unfortunately, for the past three years, his contribution as a batsman has constantly been questioned. Is that true? Well, the numbers always won't lie, right. Let's compare his performance with his own records and his competitors.

We all believe that MS Dhoni as death over specialist, he brings down all equation to the last ball of the game. In the past three years was MS Dhoni struggling with his bat?

MS Dhoni – IPL career:
		
 

From the above graph could infer see Dhoni’s performance is in declining in last two years.

MS Dhoni’s batting performance in last 3 IPL:
Let us split the T20 over as below:
Overs 1-6: Power Play
Overs 6-16: Middle Overs
Overs 16- 20: Death Overs

In the few matches Dhoni came bat during the power play but majorly came to bat in the middle overs and death overs. Ref the below stats of MSD in the last 3 years.

Overs	Balls Faced	Runs	Strike Rate
Power Play (1-6)	26	18	69.23
Middle overs (6-16)	326	296	90.79
Death overs(16-20)	251	416	165.74

From the above stats we can infer that Dhoni seems to be dangerous during the death overs. MSD struggles in power play and middle overs, but it can be considered as "MSD usually comes into play at 5/6 down, during the middle overs he to anchor the innings". This does not conclude that he is dangerous at death overs. We need to see who is asking this question.

 Neutral Cricket Fan: “Is MS Dhoni still good enough to bat?”

Let’s compare MSD performance with other team players during the death overs in last 3 years. From the below chart, we can infer that MSD in the fifth highest run scorer and seems to be a better death over batsman.
 
Do only runs matter in T20 cricket during death overs? Strike rate, the number of minimum dot balls and boundary hitting capability determines batsman as best finisher. 
On this scale out top 10 run scorer during death over, MSD is in tenth position.  


MSD is still in top ten races, but his strike rate is low and boundary per balls 4.25 is low, this mean in 4/5 ball we can expect boundary from MSD. Dot_ball_rate conveys that if MSD plays 10 balls in that there can be 4 dots balls. So, if MSD plays 5 balls in which 2 dots and 1 boundary can be expected. When compared the peers MSD figures are low. More the dot balls in death overs more pressure to the non - striker's end as well as to the team.

Conclusion:
For CSK fans MSD is still good enough to bat on comparing with existing CSK team players, on comparing with other team peers MSD is still good enough to bat??
